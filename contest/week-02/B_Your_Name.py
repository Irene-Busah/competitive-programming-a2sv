"""
khba is writing his girlfriend's name. He has n cubes, each with one 
lowercase Latin letter written on it. They are arranged in a row, 
forming a string s. His girlfriend's name is also a string t, 
consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.

To prove his love, he must check whether it is possible to rearrange 
the letters of string s so that it becomes her name t.


Input
=====
The first line contains an integer q(1≤q≤1000) — the number of 
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n(1≤n≤20).

The second line of each test case contains two distinct strings 
s and t, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.

Output
=======
For each test case, output "YES" if the letters of s can be arranged 
to form t; otherwise, output "NO".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, 
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as 
positive responses.
